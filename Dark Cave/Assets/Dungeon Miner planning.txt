Dungeon Miner planning - My homage to dungeon keeper

It should be a dungeon keeper rougelike.

You need to be the bad guy!

Leveling system for the player (You change in looks as you level up).
Dicovering the map and secrets (Must have fog of war)
Rooms to build (Bed room to rest in and save at, Library too keep spells and relics, treasure room to keep gold in, mole farm for meat (Molary - hatchery lol))
Fight monsters and heroes.

1. Look into fog of war --- Done
2. Look into room identification in the map.cs --- Done
3. Learn how to detect and assign rooms. --- Done
4. Fix and refine AI so that they can also fight for the player --- Busy
5. Create a leveling system for the player and changing sprite


--- TO DO ---
